Git and Github are different thing .
Git will automatically start to track and manage your changes.
// Git will automatically start to track and manage your changes.
There are plenty of Git-related actions that you can complete on GitHub directly in your browser, such as creating a Git repository, creating branches, and uploading and editing files.

// creating a Git repository, creating branches, and uploading and editing files.
Once you start to collaborate with others and all need to work on the same repository at the same time, youâ€™ll continually:


Push back your own changes to the same remote repository on GitHub.
--*Pull*-- all the latest changes made by your collaborators from the remote repository on Github.
Pull all the latest changes made by your collaborators from the remote repository on Github.

When you created a new branch in the previous step, GitHub brought you to the code page for your new readme-edits branch, which is a copy of main.

// On Github, saved changes are called commits. Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description 
explaining why a particular change was made. Commit messages capture the history of your changes so that other contributors can understand what you've done and why.

**This is a bold **

**Pull requests**  are the heart of collaboration on Github. When you open a pull request, you're proposing your changes and requesting  that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch. Pull requests show diffs, or differences, of the content from both branches. The changes , additions, and subtractions are shown in different colors.

a *pull request*  may introduce changes to code that conflict with the existing code on main. If there are any conflicts, Github will alert you about the conflicting  code and prevent merging until the conflicts are resolved. You can make a commit that resolves the conflicts or use comments in the pull request to discuss the conflicts with your team members.

## Setting up your profile

_Showcase_ your projects and contributions.
