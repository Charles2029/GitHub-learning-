## [About Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/about-git)

Git and Github are different thing .
Git will automatically start to track and manage your changes.
// Git will automatically start to track and manage your changes.
There are plenty of Git-related actions that you can complete on GitHub directly in your browser, such as creating a Git repository, creating branches, and uploading and editing files.

// creating a Git repository, creating branches, and uploading and editing files.
Once you start to collaborate with others and all need to work on the same repository at the same time, you’ll continually:

provision


Push back your own changes to the same remote repository on GitHub.
--*Pull*-- all the latest changes made by your collaborators from the remote repository on Github.
Pull all the latest changes made by your collaborators from the remote repository on Github.

![alt text](image-1.png):sparkle:
When you created a new branch in the previous step, GitHub brought you to the code page for your new readme-edits branch, which is a copy of main.

// On Github, saved changes are called commits. Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description 
explaining why a particular change was made. Commit messages capture the history of your changes so that other contributors can understand what you've done and why.

)

**This is a bold **

**Pull requests**  are the heart of collaboration on Github. When you open a pull request, you're proposing your changes and requesting  that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch. Pull requests show diffs, or differences, of the content from both branches. The changes , additions, and subtractions are shown in different colors.

a *pull request*  may introduce changes to code that conflict with the existing code on main. If there are any conflicts, Github will alert you about the conflicting  code and prevent merging until the conflicts are resolved. You can make a commit that resolves the conflicts or use comments in the pull request to discuss the conflicts with your team members.

## Setting up your profile
**Share** your interests and skills.
_Showcase_ your projects and contributions.
~~Express~~ your identity and show the GitHub community who you are.

## ~deploy key~
A deploy key is an SSH key that is stored on your server and grants access to a single Github repository. This key is attached directly to the repository instead of to a personal user account.

<h1>Hello code</h1>

```<h1>Hello World</h1>```

### fork
A **fork** is a personal *copy* of another user's repository that lives on your account. Forks allow you to freely make changes to a project without affecting the original upstream repository. You can ~also~ open a pull request in the upstream repository and keep your fork synced with the lates changes since both repositories are still connnected.

 [GithubPages](https://pages.github.com/)

## Links
---
You can create an inline link by wrapping link text in brackets [ ], and then wrapping the URL in parentheses ( ). You can also use the keyboard shortcut Command+K to create a link. When you have text selected, you can paste a URL from your clipboard to automatically create a link from the selection.

You can also create a Markdown hyperlink by highlighting the text and using the keyboard shortcut Command+V. If you'd like to replace the text with the link, use the keyboard shortcut Command+Shift+V.

This site was built using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Screenshot of rendered GitHub Markdown showing how text within brackets, "GitHub Pages," appears as a blue hyperlink.

Note: GitHub automatically creates links when valid URLs are written in a comment. For more information, see "Autolinked references and URLs."

When you use two or more headings, Github automatically generates a table of contents that you can access by clicking within the file header.Each heading title is listed in the table of 
contnets and you can click a title to navigate to the selected section.

Notice you can use `R` and `...`to quote something 
>Note: When viewing a conversation, you can automatically quote text in a comment by highlighting the text, then typing R. You can quote an entire comment by clicking , then Quote reply. For more information about keyboard shortcuts, see "Keyboard shortcuts."

<summary>Tips for collapsed sections</summary>

### You can add a header

You can add text within a collapsed section. 

You can add an image or a code block, too.

```ruby
   puts "Hello World"
```

</details>

```ruby
require 'redcarpet'
markdown = Redcarpet.new("Hello World!")
puts markdown.to_html
```

```javascript
console.log("come to learn Github")
```

Creating diagrams
You can also use code blocks to create diagrams in Markdown. GitHub supports Mermaid, GeoJSON, TopoJSON, and ASCII STL syntax. For more information, see "Creating diagrams."


[Creating diagrams](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-diagrams)

## [ About creating diagrams](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-diagrams)

~diagram~  rendring is available in GitHub Issues, Github Discussions, pull requests, wikis, and Markdown files.

## Using GeoJSON
how to display a map , in markdown

```geojson
{
  "type": "FeatureCollection",
  "features": [
    {
      "type": "Feature",
      "id": 1,
      "properties": {
        "ID": 0
      },
      "geometry": {
        "type": "Polygon",
        "coordinates": [
          [
              [-90,35],
              [-90,30],
              [-85,30],
              [-85,35],
              [-90,35]
          ]
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Using TopoJSON
```topojson
{
  "type": "Topology",
  "transform": {
    "scale": [0.0005000500050005, 0.00010001000100010001],
    "translate": [100, 0]
  },
  "objects": {
    "example": {
      "type": "GeometryCollection",
      "geometries": [
        {
          "type": "Point",
          "properties": {"prop0": "value0"},
          "coordinates": [4000, 5000]
        },
        {
          "type": "LineString",
          "properties": {"prop0": "value0", "prop1": 0},
          "arcs": [0]
        },
        {
          "type": "Polygon",
          "properties": {"prop0": "value0",
            "prop1": {"this": "that"}
          },
          "arcs": [[1]]
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  "arcs": [[[4000, 0], [1999, 9999], [2000, -9999], [2000, 9999]],[[0, 0], [0, 9999], [2000, 0], [0, -9999], [-2000, 0]]]
}
```
## Creating STL 3D models
You can use ASCII STL syntax directly in markdown to create interactive 3D models. To display a model, add ASCII STL syntax inside a fenced code block with the stl syntax identifier. For more information, see "Creating and highlighting code blocks."

For example, you can create a simple 3D model:
```stl
solid cube_corner
  facet normal 0.0 -1.0 0.0
    outer loop
      vertex 0.0 0.0 0.0
      vertex 1.0 0.0 0.0
      vertex 0.0 0.0 1.0
    endloop
  endfacet
  facet normal 0.0 0.0 -1.0
    outer loop
      vertex 0.0 0.0 0.0
      vertex 0.0 1.0 0.0
      vertex 1.0 0.0 0.0
    endloop
  endfacet
  facet normal -1.0 0.0 0.0
    outer loop
      vertex 0.0 0.0 0.0
      vertex 0.0 0.0 1.0
      vertex 0.0 1.0 0.0
    endloop
  endfacet
  facet normal 0.577 0.577 0.577
    outer loop
      vertex 1.0 0.0 0.0
      vertex 0.0 1.0 0.0
      vertex 0.0 0.0 1.0
    endloop
  endfacet
endsolid
```
